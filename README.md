# Airbnb Clone with Next.js

Sample project for the Advanced React with Next.js course available on <https://club.flaviocopes.com>

After cloning, run

```sh
npm install
```

Then go back to the root folder of the project and run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js server.

P.S. the app will not work out of the box, it's meant as a reference material to use during the course, because you need to first set up the database, configure the access to it, and more.
